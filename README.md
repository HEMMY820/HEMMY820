Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on cloud technologies, machine learning, and building scalable applications. Here, you'll find my contributions, projects, and the tech I’m working on.
I'm currently working on building cloud-native applications and optimizing machine learning models for production. My current focus is on creating end-to-end data pipelines using AWS and Docker, and deploying ML models in scalable, serverless environments using services like AWS Lambda and Sagemaker.
I’m diving deeper into Kubernetes for orchestration and scaling, and exploring serverless architecture with AWS Lambda. I’m also expanding my knowledge of advanced machine learning topics like reinforcement learning and generative models using TensorFlow and PyTorch.
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to AI/ML, cloud-native technologies, and data engineering.
